# 🛠️ Patch Management in Cybersecurity

**Task 6 – Security Analyst Intern @ Oasis Infobyte**  
**Author:** Mohamed Irfan

##  Objective

To explain the importance of **patch management** in maintaining system security, highlight the **risks of unpatched systems**, and outline **best practices** for implementing an effective patch management strategy.

---

##  What is Patch Management?

**Patch Management** is the process of identifying, acquiring, testing, and applying updates (patches) to software, firmware, or operating systems. These patches fix known vulnerabilities, improve performance, or add new features.

Patch management is a critical component of a strong **cybersecurity posture**, especially in large organizations where unpatched systems can become a major attack vector.

## ⚠ Consequences of Failing to Apply Patches

Failure to apply security patches in a timely manner exposes systems to serious risks:

### 1. **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities**
- Attackers actively scan the internet for systems with known, unpatched vulnerabilities.
- Examples: WannaCry ransomware exploited the unpatched **EternalBlue** vulnerability in Windows systems.

### 2. **Data Breaches**
- Outdated software can be exploited to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information.
- Example: **Equifax data breach (2017)** — caused by failure to patch Apache Struts vulnerability (CVE-2017-5638).

### 3. **System Downtime**
- Unpatched systems are more prone to crashes or malware infections, which can lead to costly business downtime.

### 4. **Loss of Reputation and Compliance Violations**
- Failing to apply patches can lead to **non-compliance** with standards like ISO 27001, PCI-DSS, or GDPR.
- This may result in legal penalties and damage to the organization’s brand image.

##  Benefits of Regular Patch Management

-  Fixes known vulnerabilities
-  Improves software performance and stability
- 🛡 Reduces attack surface
- Maintains compliance with industry standards
-  Builds trust with users and stakeholders

## 🛠 Best Practices for Effective Patch Management

### 1. **Create an Inventory**
- Maintain a list of all software and hardware assets to track patch requirements.

### 2. **Subscribe to Security Advisories**
- Follow vendor bulletins (e.g., Microsoft, Red Hat, Cisco) to stay updated on critical vulnerabilities.

### 3. **Test Patches in a Lab**
- Before deploying system-wide, test patches on a controlled environment to avoid breaking functionality.

### 4. **Automate Patch Deployment**
- Use tools like:
  - **WSUS** for Windows systems
  - **Ansible / Puppet** for Linux systems
  - **ManageEngine / PDQ Deploy** for enterprise patch automation

### 5. **Prioritize Critical Patches**
- Apply security patches based on severity (CVSS score), exploitability, and system exposure.

### 6. **Schedule Regular Patch Cycles**
- Establish a weekly or monthly patching schedule to ensure consistency.

### 7. **Document and Audit**
- Keep logs of all applied patches for compliance and auditing purposes.

##  Real-World Examples of Poor Patch Management

-  **WannaCry Ransomware (2017)**  
  Exploited MS17-010 on unpatched Windows systems, affecting over 200,000 machines worldwide.

   **Equifax Breach**  
  Failure to patch Apache Struts led to personal data of 147 million Americans being leaked.

---

##  Conclusion

Patch management is not just an IT maintenance task — it is a **core security requirement**. Regularly updating systems is the easiest and most effective way to prevent cyberattacks.

> A single missed patch can open the door to a full-scale breach.

By implementing proper patch management strategies, organizations can significantly reduce their risk and build a strong security foundation.
